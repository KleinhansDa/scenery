# scenery-0.3.0 to scenery-0.3.1

## Additions and changes

# scenery-0.2.3-1 to scenery-0.3.0

## Additions and changes

* shader loop unrolling is now supported
* add DSSDO as default ambient occlusion algorithm
* new examples: `ProceduralVolumeExample` and `ARExample`
* `PointLight`: Add a bit of margin to proxy geometry to render high-intensity lights correctly, and fix issue where position was multiplied twice with world matrix
* introduces a complete PBL implementation (based on Oren-Nayar and Cook-Torrance BRDF models), complete with an example how to use the new material properties (PBLExample): ![physically-based-lighting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/586495/36495656-43f8f69a-1736-11e8-934b-1e46777113cb.png)

* adds `Icosphere`
* DeferredLighting: Fix NdotL to be non-negative

* fixes an issue with Numerics.randomFromRange, where numbers from the wrong range were generated
* `VulkanTexture`: Correct image transitions for mipmap creation
* fixes Node::composeModel matrix composition order
* fixes compatibility issues with JDK9 (duplicate module-info.class, return values of FloatBuffer.flip(), signature of Unsafe::putInt)
